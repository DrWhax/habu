[OTR.im](https://otr.im/) was started to strengthen the OTR community by providing a hub where developers can find each other, improve their respective projects and contribute to the OTR community.

[Libotr](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/index.php#downloads) is now accessible using a new [bugtracker](https://bugs.otr.im/). This bugtracker is a new place for contributing to the reference implementation, libotr.

We also want to provide new and/or existing projects with hosting, i.e, giving them access to the bugtracker and git repositories. As of now, along with libotr, the pidgin-otr plugin is also hosted there.

However, OTR.im is not a replacement for [otr.cypherpunks.ca](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca), it is merely an addition to the community as a whole and a way to do the project hosting.

There has been increased interest in OTR and [mpOTR](https://blog.crypto.cat/2014/01/mpotr-project-plan/) the past few months. In April 2014, the [Debian OTR team](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-otr-team/Week-of-Mon-20140331/000367.html) has been announced. Furthermore, a group of cryptographers and developers is working on an mpOTR specification, which would allow more than 2 people to chat with each other using end-to-end encryption.

This initiative was brought to you by the [useotr](https://useotrproject.org/) folks, who are dedicated to strengthen the OTR ecosystem and bridging gaps between users and developers.
Since Snowden's revelations have been published the need for secure end-to-end communication has become clearer. We aim to help out with providing that. In collaboration with the libotr authors and the various implementation developers.

Last but not least, [get involved](https://bugs.otr.im/).
